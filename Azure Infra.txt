########## VIRTUAL MACHINE SCALE SET #############################
Orchestration modes for virtual machine scale sets in Azure:
Flexible orchestration: any type of vm we can  achieve
Uniform orchestration: Identical vm we can only be achieved

Scaling:
Manual: Manually we need to scale

custom: sclaes in or out based on cpu and time threshold values. It can scale upto 1000 instances

Use custom scale-in policies with Azure virtual machine scale sets:
Default: The balancing is achieved through deletion of virtual machines from the unbalanced availability zones or fault domains until the distribution of virtual machines becomes balanced.
NewestVM: This policy will delete the newest created virtual machine in the scale set, after balancing VMs across availability zones
OldestVM: This policy will delete the oldest created virtual machine in the scale set, after balancing VMs across availability zones

Upgrade policy with virtual machine scale sets
Scale sets have an "upgrade policy" that determine how VMs are brought up-to-date with the latest scale set model. The three modes for the upgrade policy are:
Automatic - In this mode, the scale set makes no guarantees about the order of VMs being brought down. The scale set may take down all VMs at the same time.
Rolling - In this mode, the scale set rolls out the update in batches with an optional pause time between batches.
Manual - In this mode, when you update the scale set model, nothing happens to existing VMs.




############## Proximity placement groups #########################
A proximity placement group is a logical grouping used to make sure that Azure compute resources are physically located close to each other. 
Proximity placement groups are useful for workloads where low latency is a requirement.
A proximity placement group is a resource in Azure. You need to create one before using it with other resources.
You can also move an existing resource into a proximity placement group. When moving a resource into a proximity placement group, you should stop 

For each proximity placement group, a colocation status property provides the current alignment status summary of the grouped resources.

Aligned: Resource is within the same latency envelop of the proximity placement group.
Unknown: at least one of the VM resources are deallocated. Once starting them back successfully, the status should go back to Aligned.
Not aligned: at least one VM resource is not aligned with the proximity placement group. 
            The specific resources which are not aligned will also be called out separately in the membership section

*** NOTE: For the lowest latency, use proximity placement groups together with accelerated networking.


############### Azure Bastion ###########################

Azure Bastion is a service you deploy that lets you connect to a virtual machine using your browser and the Azure portal. 
The Azure Bastion service is a fully platform-managed PaaS service that you provision inside your virtual network.
Bastion provides secure RDP and SSH connectivity to all of the VMs in the virtual network in which it is provisioned. 
Using Azure Bastion protects your virtual machines from exposing RDP/SSH ports to the outside world, while still providing secure access using RDP/SSH.

The Bastion host is deployed in the virtual network that contains the AzureBastionSubnet subnet that has a minimum /26 prefix.
The user selects the virtual machine to connect to.
With a single click, the RDP/SSH session opens in the browser.
No public IP is required on the Azure VM.


######################## Recovery Services vault ######################################
A Recovery Services vault is a management entity that stores recovery points created over time and provides an interface to perform backup-related operations. 
These operations include taking on-demand backups, performing restores, and creating backup policies.

You can use Recovery Services vaults to hold backup data for various Azure services such as IaaS VMs (Linux or Windows) and SQL Server in Azure VMs. 
Recovery Services vaults support System Center DPM, Windows Server, Azure Backup Server, and more. 
Recovery Services vaults make it easy to organize your backup data, while minimizing management overhead.

##################### Backup vaults ###################################
A Backup vault is a storage entity in Azure that houses backup data for certain newer workloads that Azure Backup supports. 
You can use Backup vaults to hold backup data for various Azure services, such Azure Database for PostgreSQL servers and newer workloads that Azure Backup will support.
A Backup vault is an entity that stores the backups and recovery points created over time. 
The Backup vault also contains the backup policies that are associated with the protected resources.



############################### Virtual network peering##################################
Virtual network peering enables you to seamlessly connect two or more Virtual Networks in Azure. The virtual networks appear as one for connectivity purposes. 
Azure supports the following types of peering:

Virtual network peering: Connecting virtual networks within the same Azure region.
Global virtual network peering: Connecting virtual networks across Azure regions.

Each virtual network, including a peered virtual network, can have its own gateway. A virtual network can use its gateway to connect to an on-premises network. 
You can also configure virtual network-to-virtual network connections by using gateways, even for peered virtual networks.
